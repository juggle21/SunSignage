==============

## Introduction
Various UI Angular custom diretives shared across Angular based apps developed by Rise Vision.

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

### Components
- Filter dropdown

## Built With
- *NPM*
- *AngularJS*
- *Gulp*
- *Bower*
- *Karma and Mocha for testing*

## Development

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
1. install __nodejs__ and __npm__ : go to http://nodejs.org/download/, then download and install the relavent package
2. install __bower__: `sudo npm install -g bower`
3. `npm install; bower install`

### Run Local
To preview one of the components in a browser, you can do so by using a Gulp task that is also internally used by the gulp test task (see Testing section below). Do the following:
```bash
gulp server
```

This now runs a local server at http://localhost:8099 which allows you to view the location of the E2E test HTML file of a component. Eg. http://localhost:8099/test/e2e/angular/color-picker-test-ng.html
