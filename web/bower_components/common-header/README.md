## Introduction

A responsive AngularJS-based common header implementation to be used across Rise Vision web applications and pages.

<!-- Include a description of Project Name and what it's purpose is.
This does this to achieve this for you.
Do not use acronyms.
If applicable include screenshots and other images,

Rise Vision Common Header works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- (Optional) [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) and [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) for running tests


### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
<!--provide exact details on how to setup the local environment for at least Windows, and if doable, Linux and Mac-->

``` bash
npm run dev
```

### Run Local
<!--include how to run the application locally if applicable-->

``` bash
gulp server-watch
```

And navigate to http://localhost:8099/test/e2e/index.html

#### bower.json
``` js
"dependencies": {
  "rise-vision-common-header": "https://github.com/Rise-Vision/common-header.git"
}
```

#### html
Be sure to load angular first.  Then....
``` html
    <!-- build:js script/common-header.min.js -->
    <script src="components/common-header/dist/common-header.js"></script>
    <!-- endbuild -->

    <!-- build:jsdev nothing-->
    <script src="components/common-header/src/common-header.js"></script>
    <!-- endbuild -->
```

#### gulpfile.js
For the build output, process the html file with gulp-usemin, ensuring the js
target is included and the jsdev target is ignored so that it gets removed from the html file.
...

``` js
.pipe(usemin({
  js: [uglify({mangle:false, outSourceMap: true})]
})
.pipe(gulp.dest("dist/");
```

### Testing

To run all tests at once, do

``` bash
npm run test
```

#### Unit Testing
``` bash
gulp test:unit
```

#### Protractor End-to-End Testing
A mock Google API server is included for End-to-End testing. To run tests, do

``` bash
