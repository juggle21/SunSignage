## Introduction
Common SVG icons to be shared across Rise Vision apps, widgets and components.

## Built With

- *NPM*
- *Gulp*
- *Bower*


## Development

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation

1. Install node dependencies `$ npm install`

2. Install front-end dependencies `$ bower install`

### Run Local
Run `$ gulp` to see a list of available tasks.


## Build
To build run `$ gulp build`. This will generate a `dist` folder with a `locales` folder, containing a combined and minified json file for each locale, named translation_{lang}.json.

The JSON files in `locales_json` will also be regenerated based on the existing PO files.


## Usage
Install the common-svg using bower `$ bower install git://github.com/Rise-Vision/common-svg --save`

The `dist` folder contains the minified (svg.min.js) and un-minified (svg.js) versions of the directive.

### Using the svg directive

In case you are using the provided svg Angularjs directive, you will need to include the following script reference in your main HTML page:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="components/rv-common-svg/dist/svg.js"></script>
```

Your Angularjs module will need to have a reference to *risevision.common.svg*:

    angular.module("my-module", ["risevision.common.svg"]);

### Dependencies
- Angularjs
- Angular translate
- Angular translate loader static files
